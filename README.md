# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on medical diagnostic features. It uses a cleaned dataset, explores data with visualizations, and trains models (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest) to achieve high prediction accuracy.
