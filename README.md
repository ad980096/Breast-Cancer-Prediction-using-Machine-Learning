# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on medical diagnostic features. It uses a cleaned dataset, explores data with visualizations, and trains models (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest) to achieve high prediction accuracy.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature selection and scaling
Model training and evaluation with accuracy metrics
Visualizations for better interpretability
Predictive system for new patient data

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
